## APR LinkHook

**Uniswap V4 dynamic fee hook that moves swap fees with off-chain base interest rates using ChainLink**

The swap fees paid to liquidity provider in Uniswap should always outperform the 'risk-free' interest rate. 
In Ethereum, the ETH Staking annualized return rate, best represents this 'risk-free' base interest rate.
This Uniswap V4 Hook contract dynamically adjusts the swap fee, so that the return given to liquidity providers always outperforms the 'risk-free' interest rate offered by ETH Staking.
